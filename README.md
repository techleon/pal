I am planning on developing a cross-platform application called Friends.This app has various sections in it such as the Hang-Out section, the crew section(home page) and the social section. let us discuss each of the sections in detail. The Hang-Out section enables you to create a Hang-Out event, you can set the destination or a meetup destination on the map, add friends to the event, fix the mode of transport, set reminder alarms to remind you to get ready and The cash section allows you to split the money.The Social section allows you to access Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in one place and plus this app would notify you of blocks, unfollows, pokes and unfriends whichI believe none of the above said Separate apps do.Finally, the home page will help you track your friends\' mood. You and your friends can update the mood by fixing an emoji in the home screen and there is the post of the day which anyone can update, it can be a meme, audio, video and also a gif. You can set your avatar too.
